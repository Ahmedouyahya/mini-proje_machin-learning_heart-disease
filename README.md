# Mini-Project: Machine Learning Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project for heart disease prediction. The project uses various algorithms and techniques to analyze heart disease data and build predictive models.

## Files in this Repository

- `entren_heart-disease.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning analysis
- `heart-disease.csv` - Dataset containing heart disease data
- `SVM.pdf` - Documentation for Support Vector Machines

## Dataset

The project uses a heart disease dataset (`heart-disease.csv`) to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the presence of heart disease.

## Machine Learning Approach

The notebook explores different machine learning algorithms and techniques for heart disease prediction, with particular focus on classification methods.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `entren_heart-disease.ipynb`
3. Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed
4. Run the notebook cells to see the analysis and results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common machine learning libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
